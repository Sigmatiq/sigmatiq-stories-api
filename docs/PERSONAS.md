Sigma Stories — Storyteller Personas

Overview
- Personas define narrative style, tone, and pacing for generated stories.
- MVP focuses on clear, novice-safe voices; additional styles are queued as TODOs.

MVP Personas (implemented first)
- Newsroom Neutral: Straight facts, inverted pyramid; headline + bullets + brief context; avoids adjectives that imply advice.
- Calm Guide: Reassuring, steady tone; simple analogies; emphasizes uncertainty and that doing nothing is acceptable.
- Mentor/Explainer: Patient teacher voice; defines terms inline; one concept per story; gentle takeaways.
- Minimalist: Ultra-concise; headline, two badges, one-line insight, risk note; zero fluff.

Acceptance Notes (MVP)
- Plain language only; no recommendations or deterministic claims.
- Include disclaimers and provenance in every story.
- Use probabilistic wording ("might", "could") and surface key risks.
- Fit in 60 seconds to read; Minimalist fits in 20–30 seconds.

TODO Personas (for future phases)
- Dramatic: Heightened tension/release; punchy sentences; never sensationalize.
- Thriller: Quick beats, "what’s next?" pacing; safe foreshadowing with strict disclaimers.
- Investigative: "What’s behind this move?" structure; plausible causes + caveats; provenance callouts.
- Storybook: Light narrative/metaphor; grounded and short.
- Optimistic-but-Safe: Positive framing paired with explicit risk note; avoids hype.
- Sober Risk Advisor: Risk-first framing; flags limits and data gaps; ends with "observe/learn more" options.
