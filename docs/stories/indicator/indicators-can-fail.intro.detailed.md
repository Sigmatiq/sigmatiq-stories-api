Title: When the Dials Disagree

Story
The week turned choppy. RSI stayed high while price went sideways; MACD crossed up then down; bands pinched, broke, and re‑coiled. Maya circled the mess. “This is why we don’t ask one dial for orders,” she said.

Sam’s playbook:
- Start with structure: highs and lows, trend or range.
- Add 1–2 dials that fit the scene (momentum in trends; range tools in chop).
- Watch for agreement; ignore minor conflicts.
- Decide your “no‑go” ahead of time (what invalidates the read).

She wrote: “Fewer dials, clearer story.”

One‑liner
- Dials fail when the scene changes—read the scene first, then choose the right tools.

Risks to know
- Curve‑fitting to the last chart; cherry‑picking examples; ignoring costs and time.
