Title: The Trail the Price Leaves Behind

Story
- Maya called it the trail—an average of recent prices that smooths the bumps. When Sigmatiq stayed above its trail and the trail sloped up, the path felt uphill in a good way. Dips back to the trail were like breathers on the climb.

One‑liner
- A moving average smooths price into a trail; above and rising often means “uphill for now.”

Risks to know
- Trails lag; sharp turns surprise; different lengths tell different stories—use with structure (highs/lows).
