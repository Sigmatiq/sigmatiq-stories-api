Title: Reading the Trail

Story
Maya drew two trails on Sigmatiq—one short, one longer. The short trail hugged price closely; the longer one drifted smoother and slower. “Short tells you the last few steps; long tells you the broader path,” Sam said. When price stayed above both and both pointed up, the “uphill” was clear.

When price dipped to the short trail and steadied, Maya called it a breather. When it cut below both trails and they turned flat, the path was changing.

Her note:
- Above and rising = uphill for now; below and falling = downhill for now.
- Crossbacks to the trail = breathers; multiple failed climbs = tiring.
- Trails lag turns—pair with highs/lows and volume.

One‑liner
- Moving averages turn bumps into a readable trail—use them to read the path, not to guess the next step.

Risks to know
- Sharp news can jump trails; mixed trails can conflict; lag increases with length.
