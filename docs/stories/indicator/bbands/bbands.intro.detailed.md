Title: Sleeves on the Market’s Jacket

Story
Maya traced the middle line on Sigmatiq’s chart—an average of recent prices. Around it, two sleeves widened on busy, jumpy days and narrowed during quiet spells. “Those are Bollinger Bands,” Sam said. “They mark a typical high and low zone around the average.”

One week, price pressed the upper sleeve and walked along it. “People see a touch and expect a drop,” Maya said. “But strong runs can hug the rail.” The next month, the sleeves pinched, tight as a coiled spring. A day later, price stretched out—first a feint down, then a steady push up.

Maya’s fridge note:
- Wide sleeves = lively moves; narrow sleeves = quiet coil.
- Touches = context; rides = strength; reversals = possible but not promised.
- Pair with price structure (higher highs/lows) before deciding what to watch.

One‑liner
- Bands show a typical range around an average; squeezes hint at change, and rides show strength—read the scene, don’t assume the twist.

Risks to know
- Squeezes can break either way; ranges fake out; bands lag wild jumps—never use them alone.
