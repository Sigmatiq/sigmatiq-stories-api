Title: When Price Walks the Rail

Story
- On Sigmatiq’s chart, a moving middle line wore two sleeves—upper and lower bands that widened on wild days and narrowed when things calmed. When price pressed the upper sleeve and kept walking, Sam said, “That’s a strong stride, not a guarantee to fall.” When the sleeves pinched tight, Maya called it a quiet spring—sometimes it stretched.

One‑liner
- Bollinger Bands show typical range; pressing a band can mean “strong stride,” while narrow bands hint at a coming stretch.

Risks to know
- In trends, price can “ride the band” for days; in chop, touches can whipsaw—use bands as context, not commands.
