Title: The Breath Meter on Sigmatiq

Story
- After a fast run, Sigmatiq’s stock kept climbing today. “Feels like sprinting,” Sam said. The chart’s “breath meter” (RSI) ticked high. It doesn’t predict the future; it just hints the move has been strong for a stretch—like lungs working hard on a hill. Sometimes that means a pause is near. Other times, a strong crowd keeps running and the meter stays high. Maya wrote one note: “Strong run ≠ must reverse. Watch for calmer steps or a slip back into the usual pace.”

One‑liner
- RSI is a “how hard it’s been pushing” meter—strong runs can keep running, but a pause won’t be a surprise.

Risks to know
- High readings can persist in strong trends; in choppy markets, signals can whipsaw; no single indicator should stand alone.
