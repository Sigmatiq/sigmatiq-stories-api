### The Setup
Maya stared at her screen, heart steadying. Sigmatiq had climbed for seven days in a row—on paper, a $1,000 slice would be worth about $1,180. “This feels fast,” she said, hovering over the sell button.

“Look at this dial,” Sam said gently. “RSI—think of it as a breath meter. It shows the recent push has been strong.”

“So… does high mean ‘must fall’?” Maya asked.

“Not by itself,” Sam said. “It’s context, not a command. Strong crowds can keep running; tired ones pause.”

### The Bakery Wisdom
Over lunch, Mr. Lopez wiped flour from his hands and watched the rush. “Some days we’re slammed for hours,” he smiled. “If we’ve got dough ready and a rhythm, we can keep pace. Other days we do need to slow down.”

Maya nodded. “So a high ‘breath meter’ means the pace has been strong—sometimes it keeps up, sometimes it eases.”

### The Reality Check
That afternoon, Sigmatiq wobbled a little—nothing dramatic. “People see a high reading and expect a drop,” Sam said. “Pauses are common after sprints. What matters is what happens next: does it steady, or does it slip back?”

He sketched on a napkin:
- High reading = strong recent buying
- Not a promise = trends can stay elevated; ranges can snap back
- What to watch = calmer steps, or a slip back inside the usual pace

By Friday, the price settled, then edged higher again. The dial stayed up, just not as high.

### The Note on the Monitor
Maya wrote a reminder:
- “RSI shows recent intensity, not the future.
- Sprints often pause.
- Strong trends can stay ‘out of breath’ for a while.”

One‑liner
RSI is an intensity gauge—great context for how hard the move has been; not a green/red light by itself.

Risks to know
- High or low readings can persist in strong trends; in choppy markets, signals can whipsaw; no single indicator should stand alone.

### The Beat
After a steady climb, Sigmatiq’s “breath meter” (RSI) ran hot. Maya almost sold on the number alone. Sam pointed to the tape: “Strong runs can stay strong. Watch what happens next: a calm pause, a steady hold, or a slip back.”

### The Rule
- High reading = “we’ve been pushing hard,” not “we must fall now.”
- Use RSI as context; pair it with what price does next.

One‑liner
RSI tells you how hard the recent push has been—good to know, not a command.

Risks to know
- Hot readings can linger; choppy weeks can mislead; don’t use any single dial alone.

Note
- Educational only. This story is not advice or a recommendation.

## Why This Version Is Safer (and Still Engaging)
- Keeps tension and concrete stakes (“about $1,180 on paper”) without implying performance or advice.
- Replaces hype with curiosity (“what to watch next”) and balanced language (“might,” “can”).
- Removes unvetted external links; uses curated learning block instead.
- Centers “context, not command” to prevent single‑indicator misuse.
