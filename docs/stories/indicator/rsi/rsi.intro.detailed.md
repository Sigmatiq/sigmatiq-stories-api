Title: The Day Sigmatiq’s Chart Got Out of Breath

Story
The week felt like a festival—bright headlines, busy tape, and Sigmatiq’s stock marching higher. “Feels fast,” Maya said, tracing the steps on the chart. Sam nodded. “There’s a dial some people watch—RSI. Think of it as a breath meter. It looks back at recent days and asks: were up‑steps bigger than down‑steps?” Today, Sigmatiq’s dial sat near the top.

At the bakery, Maya tried the analogy on Mr. Lopez. “When the morning rush hits, we’re moving fast,” he laughed. “Sometimes we keep going because more people show up. Other times, we slow to catch our breath.” The chart was similar: a high RSI meant Sigmatiq’s recent push was strong; it didn’t mean the push had to stop.

By afternoon, Sigmatiq wobbled—nothing dramatic, just a pause on the hill. “People see the meter high and expect a drop,” Sam said. “But trends can stay ‘out of breath’ for a while when the crowd is strong.” They wrote two rules on a sticky note:
1) A high reading means strong recent buying; it is not a promise to fall.
2) Pauses and small pullbacks after a sprint are common; watch how calm or sharp they are.

The next day, the dial slipped a little as the pace eased. Price didn’t crash; Sigmatiq shuffled sideways. “Like catching breath,” Maya smiled. A week later, momentum built again, and the meter climbed—this time more slowly. She learned to read RSI as context, not a command: in choppy weeks it sends mixed signals; in steady trends it can hover high for days. “Not a green/red light,” she said. “More like a weather note: windy today—hold your hat.”

One‑liner
- RSI shows how strong Sigmatiq’s recent push has been; useful context, not guarantees—sprints often pause, but strong crowds can keep running.

Risks to know
- High/low readings can persist in strong trends; choppy markets can whipsaw; any single indicator alone can mislead.
