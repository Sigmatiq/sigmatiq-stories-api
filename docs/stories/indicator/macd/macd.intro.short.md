Title: When the Fast Line Catches the Slow One

Story
- On Sigmatiq’s chart, two lines walked together—one fast, one slow. When the fast one crossed above the slow, Sam said, “That’s MACD hinting the pace is picking up.” When it dipped below, it hinted the pace was easing. Maya treated it like a simple “trend handoff” note, not a command: watch if price follows through or fakes out.

One‑liner
- MACD compares a fast and a slow pace; crossovers hint the balance is shifting—use as context, not a green/red light.

Risks to know
- In choppy weeks, crossovers can whipsaw; in strong trends, signals can come late; never use MACD alone.
