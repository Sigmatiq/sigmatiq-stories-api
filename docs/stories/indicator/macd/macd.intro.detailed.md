Title: The Day the Fast Foot Took the Lead

Story
Sigmatiq’s chart looked like a path where two friends walked—one with a quick step, one more measured. Sam called them the fast and slow lines. “This is MACD,” he said. “When the quick step pulls ahead, momentum is building; when it falls behind, momentum is easing.”

Maya watched a handoff. After a quiet week, the fast line rose and crossed above the slow near the open. Price didn’t explode; it firmed up, then took steady steps higher. “That’s the part people miss,” Sam said. “Crossovers are hints to watch—not orders to act.”

At the bakery, Mr. Lopez nodded at the morning rhythm. “When rush hour starts, the quick hands set the pace. If the team keeps up, the line moves. If not, things slow and we reset.” MACD’s “pace handoff” worked the same way: when the fast line leads and the gap widens (the bars grow), momentum is growing; when the gap shrinks, momentum is fading.

Later that month, a choppy spell arrived. The fast line crossed up, then down, then up again. Maya circled the whipsaws. “That’s the other part,” Sam said. “MACD struggles when the path zigzags. In trends, it helps; in noise, it nags.”

Maya’s note for her monitor:
- Fast above slow with growing gap: momentum building—watch follow‑through.
- Fast below slow with growing gap: momentum easing—watch for slips.
- Shrinking gap: momentum fading—trend may be tiring.
- In chop: expect false starts—don’t use MACD alone.

One‑liner
- MACD is a simple “who’s leading the pace” check—use it to read momentum shifts, not to predict the next step by itself.

Risks to know
- Late in strong trends; noisy in ranges; can conflict with other dials—pair with price context (higher highs/lows) and risk notes.
