Title: Dials Aren’t Oracles

Story
- Maya smiled at the wall of dials—RSI, MACD, Bands, Trails. “Helpful,” she said, “but not fortune‑tellers.” In trends, “overbought” can linger; in ranges, crossovers can whipsaw; bands can pinch then fake. Her rule: pick a few, read context (highs/lows, volume, timeframe), and avoid treating any one dial like a command.

One‑liner
- Indicators are context, not commands; pick a few and pair with price structure.

Risks to know
- Overfitting signals, chasing every wiggle, ignoring timeframe—common traps.
