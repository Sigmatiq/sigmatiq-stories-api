Title: Maya’s First Slice

Story
- Maya’s corner bakery wanted a second oven. Instead of a loan, Mr. Lopez offered tiny slices of the business to neighbors—“stocks.” Maya bought one. On busy days, more people wanted slices and the board price ticked up; on rainy days, it slipped. Some months brought a small “thank‑you” payment from profits, some didn’t. She learned not to bet everything on one shop, to add small amounts over time, and to be patient—because real kitchens have good days and messy ones.

One‑liner
- A stock is a small slice of a real business; value can grow with the business, but patience and spreading out matter.

Risks to know
- Prices can fall—sometimes quickly—and can stay down for a while; not every company wins.
