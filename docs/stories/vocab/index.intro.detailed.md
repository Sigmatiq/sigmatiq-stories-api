Title: Reading the Big Board

Story
Maya learned that an index is a rule‑based basket: which companies, how much weight for each, and how to handle changes. The chart smoothed individual drama into a broad mood. “Good for context,” Sam said, “but details matter—what’s inside, and how much.”

She kept it simple: use the big board for weather; use single charts for stories.
