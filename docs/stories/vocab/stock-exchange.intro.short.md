Title: Where Slices Change Hands

Story
- Maya and Sam visited the place where slices trade—the stock exchange. It wasn’t magic, just a marketplace that matches people who want to buy with people who want to sell. A bell marked the day’s start; a board showed prices as minds changed. Companies list there to raise money; neighbors like Maya trade slices there to join the journey.

One‑liner
- A stock exchange is a busy matching place where buyers and sellers agree on a price for slices of a company.

Risks to know
- Prices can swing fast around news; excitement or fear can move quotes more than facts in the short term.
