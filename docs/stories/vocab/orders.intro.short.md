Title: Now or Only If

Story
- At the counter, “now” means you take the next price; “only if” means you wait for your price. Market orders are “now.” Limit orders are “only if.” Maya used “only if” when she could and accepted that sometimes the line moved on.

One‑liner
- Market = now; Limit = only if. Speed vs price control.

Risks to know
- Market on fast days can slip; limits can miss; both still face fees/spreads.
