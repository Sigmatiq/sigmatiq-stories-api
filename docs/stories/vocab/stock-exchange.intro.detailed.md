Title: The Room Where Prices Meet

Story
The morning bell rang and screens lit up. Maya watched quotes flicker as the exchange matched buy and sell orders, like a careful host seating guests at the right tables. Companies list here to raise money for growth; the public trades slices here to join that story. Sometimes the floor is noisy—earnings day, big headlines; sometimes it’s calm.

Sam asked about orders. A market order says “now,” taking the best price available. A limit order says “only at this price or better,” patient and picky. Together they make the dance: urgency meets patience, and a fair price appears for that moment.

By lunchtime, Maya noticed waves—faster in the open, steadier mid‑day, lively near the close. “It’s like the bakery rush,” she smiled. The exchange didn’t promise gains; it provided a clear meeting place. Prices moved because people changed their minds.

One‑liner
- A stock exchange is a marketplace that matches buy and sell orders so slices of companies can change hands.

Risks to know
- Fast moves and thin liquidity can widen the gap between willing buyers and sellers; haste can earn a poor fill.
