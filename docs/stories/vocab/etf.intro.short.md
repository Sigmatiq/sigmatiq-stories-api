Title: One Ticket, Many Slices

Story
- Maya used an ETF like a tray—one ticket that carried many slices (an index or a theme). It was an easy way to spread risk without picking every slice by hand.

One‑liner
- An ETF lets you own a basket with one ticket—simple diversification.

Risks to know
- Fees vary; not all baskets match the label; trading still has costs.
