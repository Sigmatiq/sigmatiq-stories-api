Title: Choosing Your Place in Line

Story
Maya practiced both styles:
- Market (“now”): fast fill, less control; good when the line is short and stable.
- Limit (“only if”): price control, slower fill; good when you can wait.

On jumpy mornings, she used small size and “only if.” On steady afternoons, “now” was fine for tiny slices. She checked the gap between best buyer and seller—the spread—and avoided paying up in a rush.
