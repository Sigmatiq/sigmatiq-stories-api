Title: A Scoreboard of Many Slices

Story
- An index is a basket’s scoreboard—many slices measured together. Maya watched a broad index to sense the market’s weather: sunny, cloudy, or gusty. One name could zig while the basket zagged; the scoreboard told the bigger mood.

One‑liner
- An index measures many companies at once—a quick read on the market’s mood.

Risks to know
- Averages hide extremes; sector weights matter; not a buy/sell signal.
