Title: Find, Read, Repeat

Story
- Maya ran a simple screen—names above rising trails with calm pullbacks. She picked one, read the chart for highs/lows and pace, wrote a small note, and moved on. “Don’t marry the screen,” Sam said. “Use it to find stories to read, not orders to follow.”

One‑liner
- Screen to find, then learn to read; the list is a starting line, not the finish.

Risks to know
- Overfitting rules; chasing hot lists; ignoring fees and size.

Next Steps
- Screen and Learn (Detailed, 3‑Minute Read)
- Indicators Can Fail (Intro, 1‑Minute Read)
- Trend Following in Plain Words (Intro, 1‑Minute Read)

Note
- Educational only. Not advice.
