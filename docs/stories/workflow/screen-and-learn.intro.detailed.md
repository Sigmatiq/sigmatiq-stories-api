Title: From List to Lesson

Story
Maya’s weekly loop:
1) Run a gentle screen (rising trails, calm pullbacks).
2) Open each chart and read structure (highs/lows), pace (MACD/RSI), and range (bands).
3) Write a one‑paragraph note: what changed, why it matters, risks.
4) Keep size small; avoid crowding; move on.

She learned more from the reading than from the list. The screen found candidates; the lesson came from context.
