Title: Not One Counter, A Basket

Story
- Maya stopped stacking money on one shop. She bought small slices across a few she understood—a bookstore, a hardware shop, a bakery. When one slowed, another carried more weight. It didn’t erase dips, but it softened them. Like a basket with many handles, not one thin strap.

One‑liner
