Title: The Three Traps Sam Stepped In

Story
- Sam went “all in” on one exciting idea. When it cooled, his single slice sank—and there was nothing else to balance it. Later, he chased a fast mover, buying after a big jump; the next week, it gave back the pop. Finally, he sold in a hurry on a scary headline, only to watch the price recover after he was out. Three simple traps: betting everything on one name, buying after a rush, and panicking on noise.

One‑liner
- Most losses come from concentration, chasing, and panic—spread out, be patient, and ignore noise.

Risks to know
- Fees and taxes add up when trading often; headlines can be loud but short‑lived; even good ideas dip.
