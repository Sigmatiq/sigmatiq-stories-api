Title: The Day Sam Learned Three Simple Rules

Story
Sam loved the new juice bar. “All in,” he said, buying only that slice. A month later, a diet trend cooled; his slice sank, and there was nothing else to soften the fall. Maya called it Rule One: don’t stack everything on one counter—own a few different shops you understand.

Next, Sam chased the board after a big jump—lights bright, chatter loud. He bought high on excitement; the next week, the price drifted back. Rule Two: don’t chase pops; if you like the story, add on calm days too.

Then came a headline storm. Sam sold in a hurry; two weeks later, the board was back where it started. Rule Three: don’t let fear shove you through the door—most storms pass faster than the regrets they leave.

Maya kept a small card in her wallet:
1) Spread out: a few different businesses, not one.
2) Add slowly: schedule beats spur‑of‑the‑moment.
3) Sit tight: headlines are loud; your plan should be quiet.

It wasn’t magic. Just habits that left fewer bruises. When a slice dipped, another often steadied the basket. When a day ran hot, she didn’t buy the heat—she waited for cooler air. When noise rose, she checked her notes instead of the door.

One‑liner
- Losses often come from concentration, chasing, and panic—diversify, add steadily, and keep your seat.

Risks to know
- Even baskets drop in broad sell‑offs; schedules don’t guarantee gains; patience helps but doesn’t erase risk.
