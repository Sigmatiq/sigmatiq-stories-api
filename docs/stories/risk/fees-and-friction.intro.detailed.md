Title: The Pebbles In Sam’s Shoes

Story
Sam sprinted—buy, sell, repeat. He felt fast until the pebbles showed up: small fees, price gaps between the best buyer and seller, and a tax note for short‑term flips. Each pebble was tiny; together, they slowed him down.

Maya tried fewer, planned steps. She used limit orders when she could, accepted waiting instead of grabbing the first price, and held slices long enough to qualify for better tax treatment. Her shoes weren’t pebble‑free, but the walk felt smoother.

“It’s not just the sticker fee,” she told Sam. “It’s the little gap you cross each time you jump in and out, and what the tax timer says.”

One‑liner
- Costs hide in more than fees; spreads and taxes turn busy sprints into slower miles.

Risks to know
- Limits can miss fills on fast days; tax rules vary; planning helps but doesn’t erase friction.
