Title: Maya’s Orchard Card

Story
When Maya stopped betting everything on one counter, her wallet changed. She kept a card listing small slices in different places she understood: the bakery, a bookstore with story hour, a hardware shop that bloomed in spring. Some months, the bakery was quiet but the hardware shop buzzed; other months, the bookstore held steady while the rest wobbled.

“It feels like an orchard,” she told Sam. “Different trees, not all in season at once.”

Diversification didn’t cancel dips. It turned sharp falls into smaller stumbles. A headline that hurt one slice often left another alone. Across a year, the basket’s line smoothed compared to any single story inside it.

Sam asked, “Why not own everything?” Maya smiled. “Own enough different kinds so one surprise won’t topple the whole basket—shops that serve different needs, not copies of the same stall.”

One‑liner
- Diversification is owning several different stories so surprises don’t land in the same place at once.

Risks to know
- In broad sell‑offs, most things dip together; too many tiny slices add costs and clutter; spreading out helps, but it’s not a guarantee.
