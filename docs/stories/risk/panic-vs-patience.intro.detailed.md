Title: Keep Your Seat When The Train Shakes

Story
The week rattled. Headlines stacked up; prices dipped, bounced, dipped again. Sam felt the floor tilt and reached for the door. Maya opened her notebook instead: a small list—spread out; add on schedule; don’t buy pops; don’t sell fear.

“If the story changed, I’ll act,” she told Sam. “If the mood changed, I’ll wait.”

By Friday, the board was close to Monday’s. The shakes were real; the story hadn’t changed. The only thing that would have stuck around was the regret of a rushed exit.

One‑liner
- Patience is an action—check the story, not the noise, and keep your seat when the train shakes.

Risks to know
- Sometimes the story does change; patience isn’t denial. Have a simple plan for real change (why you’d sell) before the noise starts.
