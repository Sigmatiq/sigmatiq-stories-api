Title: The Storm That Passed

Story
- A headline hit and the board flashed red. Sam bolted for the door. Two weeks later, the price was back where it started. Maya stayed seated, checking her notes: spread out, add slowly, don’t chase noise. Not every storm needs you to run.

One‑liner
- Headlines are loud; plans should be quiet—most storms pass faster than regrets.

Risks to know
- Some storms last; staying calm is not the same as ignoring real change.
