Title: The Drips You Don’t See

Story
- Sam traded often and felt busy—in, out, and back in. Later he noticed the quiet drips: small fees, tiny gaps between buy and sell prices, and a tax bill that arrived like a surprise guest. The moves looked small alone; together they took a slice.

One‑liner
- Trading costs—fees, price gaps, and taxes—add up; fewer, calmer steps leak less.

Risks to know
- “Zero commission” doesn’t mean zero cost; price gaps (spreads) and taxes still matter.
