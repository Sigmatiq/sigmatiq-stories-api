Title: Notes from the Upstream Path

Story
Maya marked a simple checklist on Sigmatiq:
- Structure: higher highs and higher lows.
- Context: price above rising trails; fast pace leading slow (MACD).
- Entry style: add on calm pullbacks to the short trail.
- Exit style: step aside on breaks below the long trail or lower‑low resets.

She sized small and accepted misses—late starts and early exits—because the river turns. Her goal wasn’t to catch every splash, just to ride a piece of the current.
