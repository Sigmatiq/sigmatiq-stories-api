Title: Go With the River

Story
- Maya pictured the market as a river. In a steady current, she placed her raft with the flow—adding on calm eddies (pullbacks) instead of on splashes. Her map: higher highs and higher lows, price above rising trails, momentum not exhausted.

One‑liner
- Trend following is going with the river and adding on calmer water, not the splash.

Risks to know
- Rivers change; late entries sting; chop flips directions—use simple exits and size small.
